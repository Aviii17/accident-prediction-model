            <p>The Accident Prediction Model developed by Avishkar, Kautubh, Aniket, Omkar, and Aditya serves as a crucial tool for urban planners, transportation authorities, and policymakers. By analyzing historical accident data, traffic patterns, and various other parameters, their model enables accurate predictions of areas prone to accidents. This data-driven approach empowers decision-makers to implement proactive measures, such as modifying road layouts, installing additional safety features, or improving traffic management strategies.

This project not only demonstrates the technical expertise and ingenuity of our students but also highlights their commitment to creating a positive impact in society. By addressing a critical issue like accident prevention, they contribute to the broader goal of building safer and more sustainable communities.</p>
